      <p>
        I am a driven, hard-working, and creatively-inclined computer science student with
        a desire to explore the intersections of Computer Science and the areas of
        Biology, Music, and Sustainability. I have experience in C++ and Python as well
        as experience working with Unix, Mac, and Windows operating systems. I have a self-propelled
        personality that excels in working in a team and making sure that everyone's voices are heard in
        a manner that creates the most successful result.
