        This project was an idea that was expanded on in a group setting in a project class at UCSB.
        The site hopes to serve as a method for people who donate and those that need donations to
        inspire more human connection in the world. It also hopes to give organizations that may not
        have the resources to create their own site a platform in which to advertise and inform others
        of their organization. Future plans include building in a donator profile option as well as
        location and item based services. We also hope to reach out to and build partnerships with
        organizations. In creating the site, we used Javascript and React.js in conjunction with Firebase
        Database, Hosting, and Authentication services.

        "The Little Things" was conceptualized at Athena Hacks 2019 at the University of Southern
        California (USC). It is a mobile application developed with Android Studio using Java.
        Future goals for the project include implementing functionality with an online database
        service. The app aims to allow users to record small daily experiences that made them happy
        with a few key words and a picture, and then allow users to draw upon those experiences on
        bad days in hopes of helping them cheer up.
